# Syna Implementation Guide: Unified Vision

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Consolidated implementation guide for Syna AI Operating System  
**Core Principle:** Conversation orchestrates work through intelligent, living surfaces

---

## Executive Summary

Syna is an **AI Operating System where conversation is the primary interface** and agents complete multi-step work across tools without breaking user flow. Building on insights from tools like Claudia's code awareness, Syna makes all business operations conversational while preserving direct manipulation capabilities.

**Key Innovation:** Surfaces (dashboards, documents, models) are **live, editable artifacts** within conversation - not separate apps. Users can directly edit while agents observe and assist, or request changes through natural language while agents execute.

---

## Part 1: Core Architecture

### 1.1 Fundamental Components

#### Conversation Operating System
```typescript
interface SynaCore {
  // The conversation spine that orchestrates everything
  thread: Message[];
  surfaces: LiveSurface[];        // Visual work artifacts
  contextPacks: ContextBundle[];   // Reusable memory bundles
  agents: ActiveAgent[];           // Specialized capabilities
  workspace: WorkspaceContext;     // Organizational boundary
}
```

#### Surface Protocol
All visual interfaces must implement:
- **Trigger phrases** for natural language activation
- **Live editing** capability with bidirectional data flow
- **Agent binding** for observation and manipulation
- **State serialization** for interruptions and persistence
- **Lifecycle management** (appear/dismiss/persist rules)

#### Context Management System
- **Context Packs**: Reusable bundles of memory (docs, threads, datasets) attachable to any thread
- **Workspace Context**: Organization-wide knowledge and state
- **Thread Context**: Conversation-specific working memory
- **Interruption Handling**: Preserve, queue, and merge context during switches

### 1.2 Agent Architecture

#### Core Agent Capabilities
- **Planner**: Decomposes intents into tasks with dependencies
- **Researcher**: Gathers and synthesizes information
- **Writer**: Creates and edits documents
- **Engineer**: Generates code and manages technical tasks
- **Analyst**: Processes data and creates visualizations
- **Scheduler**: Manages time-based activities
- **Critic**: Reviews and validates outputs
- **Ops**: Handles automation and workflows

#### Autonomy Levels
Each task operates at one of three levels:
- **Suggest**: Proposes actions, highlights potential changes
- **Draft** (default): Creates content, shows preview, awaits approval
- **Execute**: Performs actions directly with rollback capability

---

## Part 2: Surface System Specification

### 2.1 Surface Transformation Requirements

Existing pages must be transformed into Live Surfaces:

| Current Page | Target Surface | Capabilities | Agent Integration |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| ProformaPage | ProformaSurface | Cell editing, formulas | @Analyst observes/modifies |
| MetricsDashboard | MetricsSurface | Filter controls, drill-down | @Analyst queries/updates |
| Strategy | StrategySurface | Canvas manipulation | @Planner arranges/connects |
| DocumentMemory | DocumentSurface | Rich text editing | @Writer drafts/edits |
| TaskBoard | KanbanSurface | Card movement | @Planner creates/assigns |

### 2.2 Surface Lifecycle Rules

```typescript
interface SurfaceLifecycle {
  // Surfaces appear when:
  appearTriggers: [
    'agent needs to show visual content',
    'user requests specific view',
    'task requires visual manipulation',
    'context naturally leads to visualization'
  ];
  
  // Surfaces auto-dismiss after 5 minutes unless:
  persistConditions: [
    'user is actively editing',
    'user has pinned surface',
    'agent is monitoring for changes',
    'surface has unsaved changes'
  ];
  
  // Surfaces handle interruptions by:
  interruptionBehavior: [
    'freeze current state',
    'serialize to context pack',
    'queue new context',
    'offer merge/switch/dismiss options'
  ];
}
```

### 2.3 Surface-Agent Binding

Every surface must support bidirectional agent interaction:

```typescript
interface SurfaceAgentContract {
  // Agent → Surface
  acceptProposal(changes: Change[]): void;
  applyDiff(diff: Diff): void;
  highlight(elements: Element[]): void;
  
  // Surface → Agent
  onUserEdit(callback: (edit: Edit) => void): void;
  onStateChange(callback: (state: State) => void): void;
  requestAssistance(context: string): void;
  
  // Shared
  synchronize(): Promise<SyncState>;
  getDiff(): Diff;
  validate(): ValidationResult;
}
```

## Part 3: Essential Features Implementation

### 3.1 Context Packs (Critical Priority)

Context Packs enable sub-second context switching - the defining characteristic of Syna's UX.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Pre-computed embeddings for semantic search
- Cached in memory for instant access
- Background enrichment without blocking
- Composable and shareable across threads
- Version controlled with rollback capability

**Core Functionality:**
```typescript
interface ContextPack {
  // Instant switching (cached, pre-computed)
  warm(): WarmContext;
  
  // Background enhancement (non-blocking)
  enrich(): Promise<EnrichedContext>;
  
  // Composition
  merge(other: ContextPack): ContextPack;
  filter(criteria: FilterCriteria): ContextPack;
  
  // Persistence
  serialize(): SerializedContextPack;
  restore(data: SerializedContextPack): void;
}
```

### 3.2 Quick Switcher (⌘K)

Universal command palette for all navigation and actions.

**Required Commands:**
- `>` Execute command (e.g., `>show revenue metrics`)
- `@` Mention agent (e.g., `@analyst help with model`)
- `#` Switch project (e.g., `#fundraising`)
- `/` Search surfaces (e.g., `/proforma`)
- `?` Get help (e.g., `?how to create tasks`)
- `!` Quick action (e.g., `!create task from selection`)
- `~` Switch thread (e.g., `~previous conversation`)
- `^` Open document (e.g., `^Q3 planning doc`)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Fuzzy matching across all content types
- Recent/frequent ordering
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Sub-50ms response time
- Contextual suggestions

### 3.3 Right Rail System

Four essential tabs providing workspace awareness:

**Now Tab:**
- Real-time agent activity stream
- Progress indicators with time/token usage
- Running tasks with pause/cancel controls
- Resource consumption meters

**Clips Tab:**
- Retrieved context snippets with sources
- Citation provenance tracking
- Relevance scoring
- One-click expansion to full source

**Tasks Tab:**
- Active task graph visualization
- Dependency tracking
- Status indicators (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- Owner assignments (human or agent)

**Docs Tab:**
- Linked documents with live status chips
- Version history
- Collaborative presence indicators
- Quick preview on hover

### 3.4 Interruption Model

**Required Behavior:**
1. Detect context switch request
2. Freeze all active surfaces and agents
3. Serialize current state to recoverable snapshot
4. Present options to user:
   - Dismiss current and switch
   - Keep current, add new in split view
   - Queue for later
   - Cancel interruption
5. Execute choice with full state preservation

### 3.5 Observability & Approvals

**Every agent action must be:**
- Traceable with full provenance
- Previewable before application
- Reversible with one-click rollback
- Auditable with complete logs

**Approval Gates:**
- External communications (>10 recipients)
- Repository writes (PR creation allowed, merge requires approval)
- Data modifications above threshold
- Budget exceedances (time, tokens, cost)

## Conclusion

Syna represents a new category of software that treats conversation as the operating system for knowledge work. By implementing the tasks outlined in this guide, we create a system where:

1. **Context is continuous** - No re-explanation needed
2. **Surfaces are alive** - Direct manipulation with AI assistance
3. **Agents are partners** - Configurable autonomy with human control
4. **Everything is observable** - Full provenance and rollback
5. **Work flows naturally** - Conversation orchestrates complexity

The critical path is: **Context Packs → Surface Protocol → Agent Binding → Integration Layer**

Success is measured by users completing complex multi-step workflows through natural conversation while maintaining full control and visibility.
